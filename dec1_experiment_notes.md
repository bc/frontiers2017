#Notes from cadaveric experiment:


#For next time:
- AC has to be on at least 1hr beforehand
- Need to print all muscle labels, and label all motors as M0:MN
- Mount a camera above the dissection area.
- Mount a camera above the hand during experiment with clock
- Mount a GoPro very close to the endpoint location to see minor movements in the fingertip/joints.
- Put a paper towel underneath the hand when moving it from dissection table to Neuromorphic mount.
- Replace nuts with wing nuts for the cadaver mounts so they can be moved quickly.
